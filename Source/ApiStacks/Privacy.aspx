                            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is ApiStacks' policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website,&nbsp;<a href="https://apistacks.com">https://apistacks.com</a>, and other sites we own and operate.</p>
                            <h3>Information we collect</h3>
                            <h4>Log data</h4>
                            <p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. This data is considered &ldquo;non-identifying information&rdquo;, as it does not personally identify you on its own. It may include your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.</p>
                            <h4>Personal information</h4>
                            <p>We may ask for personal information, such as your name and email address. This data is considered &ldquo;identifying information&rdquo;, as it can personally identify you. We only request personal information relevant to providing you with a service, and only use it to help provide or improve this service.</p>
                            <h4>How we collect information</h4>
                            <p>We collect information by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we&rsquo;re collecting it and how it will be used. You are free to refuse our request for this information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services without it.</p>
                            <h3>Use of information</h3>
                            <p>We may use a combination of identifying and non-identifying information to understand who our visitors are, how they use our services, and how we may improve their experience of our website in future. We do not disclose the specifics of this information publicly, but may share aggregated and anonymised versions of this information, for example, in website and customer usage trend reports.</p>
                            <h3>Data processing and storage</h3>
                            <p>We only retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide a service, or to improve our services in future. While we retain this data, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p>
                            <h3>Cookies</h3>
                            <p>We use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information about you and your activity across our site. A cookie is a small piece of data that our website stores on your computer, and accesses each time you visit so we can understand how you use our site and serve you content based on preferences you have specified.</p>
                            <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website, understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services without them.

We do not share any personally identifying information with these services without your explicit consent. We do not give these services permission to disclose or use any of our data for any other purpose.</p>
                            <p>We will refuse government and law enforcement requests for data if we believe a request is too broad or unrelated to its stated purpose. However, we may cooperate if we believe the requested information is necessary and appropriate to comply with legal process, to protect our own rights and property, to protect the safety of the public and any person, to prevent a crime, or to prevent what we reasonably believe to be illegal, legally actionable, or unethical activity.</p>
                            <p>We do not otherwise share or supply personal information to third parties. We do not sell or rent your personal information to marketers or third parties.</p>
